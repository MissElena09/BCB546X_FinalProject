# BCB546X_FinalProject

## *Panicum Mosaic Virus* and Its Satellites Acquire RNA Modifications Associated with Host-Mediated Antiviral Degradation

**Purpose:**
This assignment is the final project for BCB546X Fall 2019. 
The purpose is to create a well-documented pipeline of the chosen paper to understand the importance and difficulty of reproducing research.

**Description:**


### Pipeline

Download cluster: SRA toolkit download

Ref genomes AccesionIDs for PMV & SPMV:

 * NC_002598.1 
 * NC_003847.1
 
SRA Accession IDs:

 * SRX746906
 * SRX747740
 * SRX747746.


|**What the Authors did:** |  **What We are going to do:**   |
|---|---|
| Sequenced Samples  |  Download Data |
|  Counted Reads | Count Reads  |
||Download Ref. Genomes |
|  BLAST: Seq. Data = database Ref. Genome = queries | BLAST reads  | 
| |Tabulate results & compare to Table S1|
| Assembled into contigs with CodonCode Aligner (Contigs as query for megablast in NCBI)| Assembled into contigs with CodonCode Aligner (Contigs as query for megablast in NCBI) |

**File transfer protocol:**
1. Download FileZilla on local desktop/computer. 
2. In the toolbars, select File->Site Manager
3. Creat new site
4. * Host:hpc-class.its.iastate.edu
   * Protocol: SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol
   * Type: Interactive
   * User: yourNetID
   * In AdvancedSetting, put /ptmp/zlozier as the remote directory. 
 Then Connect!
 
 Different hpc cluster might have different file transfer protocols
